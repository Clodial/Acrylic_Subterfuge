What is Acrylic Subterfuge?

  - Acrylic Subterfuge is a simple top-down shooter-esque game tha can get easier or progressively harder as the game goes on. 

Wait, what do you mean it gets harder?

  - Well, first off, the controls are simple. use WASD to move and the arrow keys to fire at enemies. 
  - What makes this game hard is its use of changing visual effects and control switching. 
  
So, can this game cause seizures?

  - First off, this game isn't even done yet nor do you even have all of the art assets I used to make this game. 
  - So, no, it can't cause seizures. It doesn't even have a win goal yet.
  
When will you finish it?
 
  - When I get around to finishing it. Block Stack is my bigger priority, at the moment, alongside a couple other prototypes 
  I want to mess around with making, first.
